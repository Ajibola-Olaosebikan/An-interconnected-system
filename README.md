# An-interconnected-system
This modular software exercise was built to test my ability in python basics: list, dictionaries, tuples, functions and for-loops. 
There are five modules; the text-user-interface (TUI), the process, the database, the visual and the main module.
A core aspect of this project is the database that involves design of normalized database for retrieval of specific data record.
The main module coordinates the operations of the system.

Interestingly, the only python libraries used throughout this entire project are; matplotlib, SQlite and csv,
